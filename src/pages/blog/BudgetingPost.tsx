    <h2>Budgeting Challenges for Nigerian Students</h2>
    <p>
      As a student in Nigeria, managing finances can be tough. With rising costs for tuition, transport, and data bundles in cities like Lagos or Ibadan, every Naira counts. These budgeting tips, paired with Nivalus Bank’s tools, can help you stay on track.
    </p>
    <h2>Practical Budgeting Tips</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Track Expenses with Nivalus’s Budget Planner:</strong> Use our free Budget Planner to log daily expenses (e.g., ₦500 on transport). Identify spending patterns to cut waste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prioritize Needs Over Wants:</strong> Focus on essentials like food and textbooks before spending on data bundles or outings. A ₦2,000 meal can cover two days of groceries.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Leverage Student Discounts:</strong> Many Nigerian businesses offer student discounts. Carry your ID to save on transport (e.g., BRT buses) or tech subscriptions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Save Small Amounts:</strong> Deposit ₦1,000 monthly into a Nivalus student savings account. Even small savings grow with our competitive interest rates.
