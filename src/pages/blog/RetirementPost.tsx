    <h2>Why Retirement Planning Matters in Korea</h2>
    <p>
      With South Korea's rapidly aging population and one of the world's lowest birth rates, retirement planning has become a national concern. The average life expectancy has reached 83.5 years (World Bank, 2023), meaning retirees need to prepare for longer retirement periods. Whether you're a young professional in Seoul or planning your golden years in Busan, proper financial preparation is essential for maintaining your quality of life. At Nivalus Bank, we offer retirement solutions tailored to Korea's unique economic landscape.

    <h2>Top Tips to Save for Retirement in Korea</h2>

        <strong>Enroll in the National Pension Service (NPS):</strong> Korea's mandatory pension system requires employees to contribute 4.5% of their salary, matched by employers. Consider voluntary additional contributions to boost your retirement income.
