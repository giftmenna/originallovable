    <h2>What is Forex Trading?</h2>
    <p>
      Forex (foreign exchange) trading involves buying and selling currencies to profit from exchange rate fluctuations. In Nigeria, forex is popular due to Naira volatility (e.g., ₦1,600/USD in 2025). However, it’s a high-risk activity that requires knowledge and discipline.
    </p>
    <h2>Forex Trading Basics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Currency Pairs:</strong> Traded in pairs like EUR/USD (Euro vs. US Dollar). The first currency is the base, and the second is the quote. If EUR/USD is 1.08, 1 Euro buys 1.08 USD.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pips and Spreads:</strong> A pip is the smallest price movement (e.g., 0.0001). The spread is the difference between buy and sell prices, affecting your costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Risks:</strong> Leverage (e.g., 50:1 per CBN regulations) amplifies gains and losses. Market volatility can wipe out investments without proper risk management.
      </li>
